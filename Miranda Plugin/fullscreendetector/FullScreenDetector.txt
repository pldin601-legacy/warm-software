Installation:

The FullScreenDetectorMirandaPlugin.dll file must be placed in the Plugins folder
in the Miranda folder.

Notes:

Plugin periodically checks if there is a fullscreen window open.
If it is open, it changes your status. You can set it in the plugin's option dialog,
which status will be used then. Useful for gamers or simply if you do not want to
be bothered when you are watching a movie or playing a game.
