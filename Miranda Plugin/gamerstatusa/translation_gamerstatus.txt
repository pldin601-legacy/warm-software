;[Import old gamerStatus settings?]

;[gamerStatus settings are now structured in groups,\nwhich have the same settings and away-message for several games/processes.\nDo you want to import all games/processes into ONE group instead of several groups for each game/process?\n\nNOTE: All away-messages but one will be lost and you'll have to correct the settings in the options.]

;[import gamerStatus settings into ONE group?]

;[Do you want to delete the old settings?,\nyou won't be able to use them again if you go back to an older version of gamerStatus!\n\nNOTE: The old settings are totally independent from the new settings!]

;[GamerStatus Plugin encountered a problem. Processlist stuff probably won't work.\nPlease contact the author at mistag@baze.de, if you want this problem to be fixed.\n\n(Error msg: enumProcs init failed! Return value: %i)]

;[GamerStatus variables]

;[LaunchInfo.txt is a file that's created by The All-Seeing Eye (www.udpsoft.com/eye)\nor GameSpy (www.gamespy.com) and contains information about the game server you connect on.\n\nThis data can be used in this dialog, once set a correct LaunchInfo.txt path,\nyou can see all the data it contains on the right side of the dialog and insert them\ninto your custom %launchinfo% variable, which can be used in every status-message of gamerStatus.]

;[LaunchInfo - What's this?]

;[Range: 0 (disabled) - 31\nIf a delay is activated (>0), gamerStatus waits before activating if a program is detected running.\nThis is helpful to avoid often status-changes if a program is only running for a short time.\nThe deactivation-delay is helpful if a program terminates and starts again after a short time.\n\nNOTE: The format is NOT in seconds, but in ticks:\nThe length of a tick is specified by the timer interval in the main options menu.]
